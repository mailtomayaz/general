<h3>AUSTIN RATLIFF</h3>
<h4>PROJECT COORDINATOR</h4>
<p>Austin Ratliff is the project coordinator for iota Outdoors and is the company&rsquo;s jack of all trades. Austin grew up the youngest of three Ratliff brothers on a farm and ranch in Boyd, Texas. Hunting, fishing, working and fixing things were a by-product of the stereotypical Texas upbringing. Austin received a visualization degree from Texas A&amp;M University&rsquo;s College of Architecture with a focus in 3-D animation and computer graphics. His dedication to detail and visual aesthetics as well as his unique set of computer skills provide great value to product development and marketing at iota Outdoors. Austin&rsquo;s dream hunt includes an Arctic Wolf with his totally tricked out Horizon Firearms 6.5 Creedmoor.</p>

<h3>MCKENZIE CROW</h3>
<h4>OFFICE MANAGER</h4>
