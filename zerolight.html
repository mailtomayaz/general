<h1 class="section2-title">the problem</h1>
<p>On a cattle ranch in rural Texas, our founder, Derrick Ratliff, searched for his cell phone in the dark. Seconds earlier, he had caught the shining green bulbs of a coyote&rsquo;s eyes in the beam of his spotlight. Now, Derrick had a scant amount of time to adjust his scope turret for an accurate shot, but in the dark of the night, he needed to shine his phone light to see the turret markings.<br /><br />Meanwhile, over 1,000 miles away and deep in Wyoming's countryside, Derrick's friend and hunting buddy Hazer Bulkley spent the early morning hours in a cold truck cab, spotlighting coyotes often hundreds of yards away. He, too, became frustrated with the disadvantage of darkness as he attempted to adjust his turrets and level his rifle.<br /><br />Derrick and Hazer realized there were only two options available at the time for anti-canting in low-light situations. The first was to fumble for a light, wasting valuable time and possibly giving away their location. The second was to wing it sans light and hope for the best. Neither option offered the solution they wanted.</p>

<p><span>iota designed a baffled-channel LED light system and merged it with an anti-cant leveling device to create iota ZEROLIGHT. Our patent pending technology provides the necessary illumination to allow a hunter or shooter to accurately position their turret, level and horizontal axis on their rifle scope during conditions with little to zero light.</span></p>
