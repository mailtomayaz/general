Wanting to be more hands on with his work, he sought out work in the firearms industry and landed a job at Horizon in early 2016. His experience in firearms and background in research lend to Michael&rsquo;s out-of-the-box problem solving &ndash; streamlining the rifle building process while maintaining the utmost quality.
