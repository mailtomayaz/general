          <h14>Business the Texas Way</h14>
          <p>
     <p>
              in 2014, Texas Precious Metals was recognized as the #1 Fastest Growing Aggie-owned or led business in the world by Texas A&M University , 
              and in 2015 by Inc. 500 as the #200 Fastest Growing Private Company in America. 
              We achieved this recognition by doing business differently than other precious metals dealers.
              With low premiums, free shipping, spectacular products, 
              and fanatical customer service, there is no other company like us. 
              To help ease the anxiety of purchasing bullion online, 
              we reinvented our industry by focusing on the delivery speed of packages. 
              We sell only what we have in stock, and we are the only dealer that ships all packages via overnight delivery.

          <p>    
Texas Preciouse Metals LLC is a spinoff of Kaspar Companies, 
owned and operated by the Kaspar fifth generation. 
Since 1898, the Kaspar Family of Companies has been doing business the right way in southern Texas.
We're proud to say that our famiy of business spans twenty recessions, One depression, 
tow world wars, oil embargons, steel shortages, and twenty presidential administrations, 
Texas Precious Metals began as a precious metals wholesaler, selling gold and silver bullion exdlusively to coin shops and local retailers. 
We still maintain a wholesale bullion business. In May 2011, we expended the company to the retail market, 
competing against more well-known (though less established) dealers. 
Texas Precious Metals is rated A+ with the Better Business Bureau.
